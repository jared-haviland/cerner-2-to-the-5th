# Pascal's Triangle

This Python program takes a number as input and then prints out a Pascal's triangle with that many rows!

A [Pascal's triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_triangle) is a triangle of numbers such that each number is the sum of the two numbers above it (except the very top of the triangle, which is always 1). Here is an example of a Pascal's triangle with 10 rows:

```
                   1
                 1   1
               1   2   1
             1   3   3   1
           1   4   6   4   1
         1   5   10  10  5   1
       1   6   15  20  15  6   1
     1   7   21  35  35  21  7   1
   1   8   28  56  70  56  28  8   1
 1   9   36  84 126 126  84  36  9   1
```

(I was able to print out the triangle nicely with help from user "200_success" on the StackExchange post [here](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/43223/pretty-print-pascals-triangle))
