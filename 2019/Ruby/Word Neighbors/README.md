# Word Neighbors

Continuing the theme of playing around with words, this Ruby program finds all of the "neighbors" of a given word.  It considers orthographic neighbors (words of the same length which differ by only one letter) as well as words that result from adding or removing a single letter.

Example:
```
Enter a word to get all of its neighbors: blue
belue, blae, blee, blub, blume, blup, blur, clue, flue, glue, lue, slue
```
